abstract = {Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging protocols for the assessment of quantitative information suffer from long acquisition times since multiple measurements in a parametric dimension are required. To facilitate the clinical applicability, accelerating the acquisition is of high importance. To this end, we propose a model-based optimization framework in conjunction with undersampling 3D radial stack-of-stars data. Theory and Methods: High resolution 3D T 1 maps are generated from subsampled data by employing model-based reconstruction combined with a regularization functional, coupling information from the spatial and parametric dimension, to exploit redundancies in the acquired parameter encodings and across parameter maps. To cope with the resulting non-linear, non-differentiable optimization problem, we propose a solution strategy based on the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method. The importance of 3D-spectral regularization is demonstrated by a comparison to 2D-spectral regularized results. The algorithm is validated for the variable flip angle (VFA) and inversion recovery Look-Locker (IRLL) method on numerical simulated data, MRI phantoms, and in vivo data. Results: Evaluation of the proposed method using numerical simulations and phantom scans shows excellent quantitative agreement and image quality. T 1 maps from accelerated 3D in vivo measurements, e.g. 1.8 s/slice with the VFA method, are in high accordance with fully sampled reference reconstructions. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm is able to recover T 1 maps with an isotropic resolution of 1 mm 3 from highly undersampled radial data by exploiting structural similarities in the imaging volume and across parameter maps.},

abstract = {High-performance computing has recently seen a surge of interest in heterogeneous systems, with an emphasis on modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These devices offer tremendous potential for performance and efficiency in important large-scale applications of computational science. However, exploiting this potential can be challenging, as one must adapt to the specialized and rapidly evolving computing environment currently exhibited by GPUs. One way of addressing this challenge is to embrace better techniques and develop tools tailored to their needs. This article presents one simple technique, GPU run-time code generation (RTCG), along with PyCUDA and PyOpenCL, two open-source toolkits that supports this technique. In introducing PyCUDA and PyOpenCL, this article proposes the combination of a dynamic, high-level scripting language with the massive performance of a GPU as a compelling two-tiered computing platform, potentially offering significant performance and productivity advantages over conventional single-tier, static systems. The concept of RTCG is simple and easily implemented using existing, robust infrastructure. Nonetheless it is powerful enough to support (and encourage) the creation of custom application-specific tools by its users. The premise of the paper is illustrated by a wide range of examples where the technique has been applied with considerable success. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A constrained optimization type of numerical algorithm for removing noise from images is presented. The total variation of the image is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the noise. The constraints are imposed using Lanrange multipliers. The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t → ∞ the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

The assumption of total variation is that images consist of areas, which are piecewise constant. However, in many practical magnetic resonance imaging situations, this assumption is not valid due to the inhomogeneities of the exciting B1 field and the receive coils. This work introduces the new concept of total generalized variation for magnetic resonance imaging, a new mathematical framework, which is a generalization of the total variation theory and which eliminates these restrictions. Two important applications are considered in this article, image denoising and image reconstruction from undersampled radial data sets with multiple coils.

abstract = {In radial fast spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a set of overlapping spokes with an inconsistent T2 weighting is acquired, which results in an averaged image contrast when employing conventional image reconstruction techniques. This work demonstrates that the problem may be overcome with the use of a dedicated reconstruction method that further allows for T2 quantification by extracting the embedded relaxation information. Thus, the proposed reconstruction method directly yields a spin-density and relaxivity map from only a single radial data set. The method is based on an inverse formulation of the problem and involves a modeling of the received MRI signal. Because the solution is found by numerical optimization, the approach exploits all data acquired. Further, it handles multicoil data and optionally allows for the incorporation of additional prior knowledge. Simulations and experimental results for a phantom and human brain in vivo demonstrate that the method yields spin-density and relaxivity maps that are neither affected by the typical artifacts from TE mixing, nor by streaking artifacts from the incomplete k-space coverage at individual echo times.},

@article{Donoho2006,
abstract = {Suppose x is an unknown vector in Ropfm (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0{\textless}ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0{\textless}ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces},

@article{Lustig2007,
abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the ℓ1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = 	{T2 relaxometry refers to the quantitative determination of spin-spin relaxation times in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Particularly in clinical diagnostics, the method
provides important information about tissue structures and respective pathologic alterations. Unfortunately, it also requires comparatively long measurement times which
preclude widespread practical applications. To overcome such limitations, a so-called model-based reconstruction concept has recently been proposed. The method allows
for the estimation of spin-density and T2 parameter maps from only a fraction of the usually required data. So far, promising results have been reported for a radial data
acquisition scheme. However, due to technical reasons, radial imaging is only available on a very limited number of MRI systems.
The present work deals with the realization and evaluation of different model-based T2 reconstruction methods that are applicable for the most widely available Cartesian
(rectilinear) acquisition scheme. The initial implementation is based on the conventional assumption of a mono-exponential T2 signal decay. A suitable sampling scheme as well as an automatic scaling procedure are developed, which remove the necessity of manual parameter tuning. As demonstrated for human brain MRI data, the technique allows for a more than 5-fold acceleration of the underlying data acquisition. Furthermore, general limitations and specific error sources are identified and suitable simulation programs are developed for their detailed analysis. In addition to phase variations in image space, the simulations reveal truncation effects as a relevant cause of reconstruction artifacts. To reduce the latter, an alternative model formulation is developed and tested. For noisefree simulated data, the method yields an almost complete suppression of associated artifacts. Residual problems in the reconstruction of experimental MRI data point to the predominant influence of other errors in practice.
The last part of this thesis focuses on the development of a refined T2 reconstruction technique which employs a signal model that considers contributions from stimulated
echoes to the spin-echo signal. The method yields an increased accuracy of the estimated T2 relaxation times. In comparison, however, the mono-exponential model proves to
be less sensitive to artifacts when the data acquisition is highly accelerated. This T2 relaxometry method is currently evaluated in a first clinical trial.},

@article{Roeloffs2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Quantitative parameter mapping in MRI is typically performed as a two-step procedure where serial imaging is followed by pixelwise model fitting. In contrast, model-based reconstructions directly reconstruct parameter maps from raw data without explicit image reconstruction. Here, we propose a method that determines T1 maps directly from multi-channel raw data as obtained by a single-shot inversion-recovery radial FLASH acquisition with a Golden Angle view order. Joint reconstruction of a T1, spin-density and flip-angle map is formulated as a nonlinear inverse problem and solved by the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method. Coil sensitivity profiles are determined from the same data in a preparatory step of the reconstruction. Validations included numerical simulations, in vitro MRI studies of an experimental T1 phantom, and in vivo studies of brain and abdomen of healthy subjects at a field strength of 3 T. The results obtained for a numerical and experimental phantom demonstrated excellent accuracy and precision of model-based T1 mapping. In vivo studies allowed for high-resolution T1 mapping of human brain (0.5–0.75 mm in-plane, 4 mm section thickness) and liver (1.0 mm, 5 mm section) within 3.6–5 s. In conclusion, the proposed method for model-based T1 mapping may become an alternative to two-step techniques, which rely on model fitting after serial image reconstruction. More extensive clinical trials now require accelerated computation and online implementation of the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Abstract New diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods, including high-b, q-space, and high angular resolution MRI methods, attempt to extract information about non-Gaussian diffusion in tissue that is not provided by low-b-value (b ≈ 1000 s mm−2) diffusion or diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI). Additionally, DWI data with higher spatial resolution are being acquired to resolve fine anatomic structures, such as white matter fasciculi. Increasing diffusion-weighting or decreasing voxel size can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio so that some DWI signals are close to the background noise level. Here we report several new artifacts that can be explained by considering how background noise affects the peanut-shaped angular apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) profile. These include an orientationally dependent deviation from Gaussian behavior of the ADC profile, an underestimation of indices of diffusion anisotropy, and a correlation between estimates of mean diffusivity and diffusion anisotropy. We also discuss how noise can cause increased gray/white matter DWI contrast at higher b values and an apparent elevation of diffusion anisotropy in acute ischemia. Importantly, all of these artifacts are negligible in the b-value range typically used in DT-MRI of brain (b ≈ 1000 s mm−2). Finally, we demonstrate a strategy for ameliorating the rectified noise artifact in data collected at higher b values. Magn Reson Med 52:979–993, 2004. Published 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This toolbox allows the estimation of high-quality multi-parameter qMRI maps (longitudinal and effective transverse relaxation rates R1 and R2⋆, proton density PD and magnetisation transfer MT saturation) that can be used for quantitative parameter analysis and accurate delineation of subcortical brain structures. The qMRI maps generated by the toolbox are key input parameters for biophysical models designed to estimate tissue microstructure properties such as the MR g-ratio and to derive standard and novel MRI biomarkers. Thus, the current version of the toolbox is a first step towards in vivo histology using MRI (hMRI) and is being extended further in this direction. Embedded in the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) framework, it benefits from the extensive range of established SPM tools for high-accuracy spatial registration and statistical inferences and can be readily combined with existing SPM toolboxes for estimating diffusion MRI parameter maps. From a user's perspective, the hMRI-toolbox is an efficient, robust and simple framework for investigating qMRI data in neuroscience and clinical research.},

abstract = {Purpose To develop a model-based reconstruction technique for single-shot T1 mapping with high spatial resolution, accuracy, and precision using an inversion-recovery (IR) fast low-angle shot (FLASH) acquisition with radial encoding. Methods The proposed model-based reconstruction jointly estimates all model parameters, that is, the equilibrium magnetization, steady-state magnetization, 1/ , and all coil sensitivities from the data of a single-shot IR FLASH acquisition with a small golden-angle radial trajectory. Joint sparsity constraints on the parameter maps are exploited to improve the performance of the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method chosen for solving the nonlinear inverse problem. Validations include both a numerical and experimental T1 phantom, as well as in vivo studies of the human brain and liver at 3 T. Results In comparison to previous reconstruction methods for single-shot T1 mapping, which are based on real-time MRI with pixel-wise fitting and a model-based approach with a predetermination of coil sensitivities, the proposed method presents with improved robustness against phase errors and numerical precision in both phantom and in vivo studies. Conclusion The comprehensive model-based reconstruction with L1 regularization offers rapid and robust T1 mapping with high accuracy and precision. The method warrants accelerated computing and online implementation for extended clinical trials. Magn Reson Med 79:730–740, 2018. © 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.},
